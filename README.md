Lecutre Notes : Mathematical Science (Freshman)
=====

## Overview

This repository is the collection of LaTeX files, which is the lecture notes of the mathematics classes I took when I was a freshman at the University of Tokyo.
（このレポジトリは，私が大学１年生だった頃に受けた数学，又は物理の授業のノートを元にして作成したLaTeXファイルを集めたものです．）

## Contents

#### 1. Calculus（微分積分学）

Based on the year-long class "Calculus"(Mon 4) by Kazuhiro Ishige.

#### 2. Category and Shelf（圏と層）  

Based on the specialized seminer "Category and Shelf"(1A Mon 5) by Takeshi Saito.

#### 3. Lebesgue Integral （ルベーグ積分論）

Based on the specialized seminer "Lebesgue intergral and Soblev space"(1A Mon 2) by Tsuyoshi Yoneda. 
*I couldn't attend this class, so most the lecture notes are provided by my friend Yu, I would like to space some space here to express my gratitude to Yu.

#### 4. Electrodynamism and Vector analysis（電磁気学とベクトル解析）

Based on the specialized seminer "The mathematics used in electrodynamism"(1A Fri 2) by Kazuhiko Kiyono, and "Mathematics in your own pace"(year-long Fri 5) by Toru Gocho.

##### 5. Physical Science（物理科学）

In order to give Yu something in return, Shu and I decided to help him with his reports in the class "Physical Science for Humanities and Social Science Studens" by Yuki Yokokura.

## Licenses

Not sure of anything. I'm not thinking about making it public, just share with the people that I'm in contact with.
